# SIGMA
Student Interested in GPS Mathematics and Analysis (SIGMA) Visual Basic .net GPS Post-Processing Software
by: Ryan Brazeal
date: April, 2015

This project was created primarily for a geomatics graduate course at the University of Florida.
However, the project contains an amalgamation of previous GPS related software utilities that I have created over the years.

There are currently 5 primary applications within SIGMA
1) Point Positioning Processing Static Engine
2) Differential Positioning Processing Static Engine (including LAMBDA and MLAMBDA ambiguity resolution methodologies)
3) Theoretic Dilution of Precision (DOP) estimator
4) GPS Single Point Localization (Map Projection) and Canadian Geoid Model (.byn) Engine
5) Serial based GARMIN download utility (partial development)

I apologize as the code is not the prettiest and currently NOT well documented. These will be future aims of this project.

I welcome any and all contributors and feedback/questions.

Once my final report has been approved I will included it here. It contains a lot of the theoretic details behind differential GPS processing with the aim of hopefully help those who are interested in the topic understand it a little bit easier.

Link to my [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1188.7525).

Thanks,

Ryan
